On the Rail-Away, the industrial crew have decided to offer both! As the age of steam has arrived to Faer\u00fbn and trains went from fantastical machines to every day occurrences, a series of railroads have emerged throughout the Sword Coast and beyond. The Rail-Away is one of many services now provided to transport people and cargo at much improved speeds. Under current management, new destinations and track has been added and the service of this train has been expanded year on year. With a service this long however, trips take multiple nights and so a full set of sleeper carts are provided, catering for all different kinds of clientele. The service you all will be taking today will be the train from Mirabar, the rich mining town at the northern-most reaches of Faer\u00fbn, down to Baldur's Gate. Making frequent stops along the sword coast, this has become a very popular route to take.</p>"},{"location":"Rail-Away%20One%20Shot/Introduction/#what-you-need-to-do","title":"What you need to do","text":"<p>Please prepare a level 5 character, any class or race (anything outside the PHB or multi-classing please let me know).

We will start at the Mirabar station and work our way down over ideally a few days. Everyone on this train will require a ticket to board and stay.

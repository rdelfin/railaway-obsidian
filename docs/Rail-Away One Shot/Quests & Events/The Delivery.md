-** If they find [[Dretin Dalmura]], she will tell them:
	- She's uncomfortable going out in the sunlight
	- Needs a package delivered in the next stop ASAP
		- Nebble's Potion Emporium
	- Asks the party to take the box and 250 gold, and that they can keep 50 gold as payment
	- Also tells them to **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TO OPEN THE BOX** as the contents are very fragile
## Delivery
- Once they arrive at Nebble's potion emporium, they'll find
- Nebble Grimmfolk, a rather slimy-looking human male
- Use [Spy](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spy#content)

	- [Quasit](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Quasit#content)
- If outside, they will likely vanish and try to scatter
- If in the train, they will be stuck in the carriage with you
- NPCs should attempt to clean up the mess they caused
- Once Dretin finds out, she will try to attack the players
	- Can be convinced with full 250 GP payment or a DC 16 intimidation
	- Players might come up with other ideas

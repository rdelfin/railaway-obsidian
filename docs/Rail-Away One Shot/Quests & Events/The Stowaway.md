## Investigation
- If they ask around staff, they'll get the same stories
- If they continue investigating the carriages, they'll catch glimpses of what looks lke a child where there shouldn't be
- (passive perception > 14) they'll hear a noise from above and the smell of food
- They'll find a small camp on the roof with a bedroll and a bag
- They can search for Ryman, or wait at his camp
## When caught
- Ryman will bed the party to let him say, act as an informant
- He also promises to stop stealing food if the party bring him meals
- Just trying to travel (truthful)
- (once Lord Gammon and Lord Almanor are on the train) he will reveal something juicy is afoot
## Turn in (or not)

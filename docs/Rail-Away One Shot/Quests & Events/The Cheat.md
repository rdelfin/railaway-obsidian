- [[Kogan Hamfist]] gives this quest
- Suspects cheating happening in the [[Golden Coin]], but no specific names
- If pushed, guests have reported losing big, but haven't wanted to fess up who
- 100GP in exchange for catching the responsible party in the act 
	- Kogan needs SOLID PROOF, either **a confession** or **an explanation** of how the cheating is happening
## Main Part
- If players go to the Golden Coin, they will find:
	- At poker:
		- [[Hammond Axman]] playing poker
		- [[Preston Hillmore]] also playing poker
		- Female elf called Galstine
		- Member of staff running the game (halfling called Erwick Ferndew)
	- Chess:
		- [[Verity Billett]]
		- [[Somen Gilrona]]
	- Checkers:
		- Female Halfling called Frona Crow
		- Male human called Tom Smith
- Most people at the poker table seem frustrated (except Hammond)
	- They will need to play for a bit to realise
	- If they play, they'll lose 2d6+5 GP
- If they start struggling, bring out The Gambler
- If things need to move faster, ask for a perception check (DC 15)
	- If they go over, they will notice a pendant around his neck
	- If asked, Hammond will try to deflect, but on an insight check, he'll seem sweaty

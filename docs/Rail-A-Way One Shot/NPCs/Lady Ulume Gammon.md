### Day 2
- **Dinner**: Lord Almanor has a hushed conversation with Lord Gammon, which Gammon seems to laugh off. If the player characters are present, they will hear the phrases “Don’t think your secrets are mine” and “a small price to pay”.
- **Dinner**: Lord Almanor sends a note to Verity. Verity reads the note, adds to it and returns it via Bishel to Raivo, who throws it away
- **Dinner**: Just before dessert, Raivo and the staff deliver a special cocktail to everyone at Lord Almanor’s table, save for Bishel. “A special drink to go with your dessert course,” says Raivo.
- **Dinner**: After dessert is served, Lord Almanor makes a toast: “To old friends and new!” drinking the cocktail, and encourages everyone to join him in the toast.
- **Dinner**: After the song, Lord Almanor tells Lord Gammon, “Perhaps you will reconsider my proposal… after you get a good night’s sleep.” Though polite, it somehow sounds like a threat.

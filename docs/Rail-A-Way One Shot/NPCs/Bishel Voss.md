### Day 2

- **Afternoon**: Lord Almanor sends dinner invitations to Lord and Lady Gammon, and the party if they completed his request. The invitation reads “A treat for the senses that only the privileged can enjoy!”
- **Dinner**: Lord Almanor has a hushed conversation with Lord Gammon, which Gammon seems to laugh off. If the player characters are present, they will hear the phrases “Don’t think your secrets are mine” and “a small price to pay”.
- **Dinner**: Lord Almanor sends a note to Verity. Verity reads the note, adds to it and returns it via Bishel to Raivo, who throws it away.

- **After Dinner**: Lord Gammon leaves to visit the Observation Car, inviting the party to join his walk. He takes the warm milk with him, and discusses a potential job for the adventurers.
